Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
  - My class represents a bird that can implement all methods from Contract; shrink() represents a health deterioration while grow() represents a health improvement.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
  - showOptions(), setName(string), Birdie(string), isValidDirection(string), getReverse(string).
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  - Working with interfaces gives a programmer quite some space to be creative with solving a problem!
